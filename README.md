# Hi all 👋☕️

My name is [Danilo Diez](https://www.danilodiez.com/). I'm a software engineer working currently at [LenioLabs](https://leniolabs.com/). I also have a degree in Systems Engineering 👨🏻‍💻

I love coding and building things, I use nvim btw 😝. I'm interested in contributing to open source, specially frontend, web and AI projects. I also love reading, playing the guitar and being in the nature 🌳☮️
